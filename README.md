# Kaggle_Iceberg

In the Kaggle competition "Statoil/C-Core Iceberg Classifier Challenge" participants were challenged to build machine learning algorithms to automatically detect whether an object on a satellite image is an iceberg or a ship. Details about the competition and the data can be found here:

Here I present my solution to this competition, which got me to rank 522 out of 3343 participants (top 16%).
